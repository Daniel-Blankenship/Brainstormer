    <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
    <p>
        A user is working on a project by themselves. The user organizes their ideas in the mind map so that they can see the bigger picture. Viewing the mind map that they created helps them understand the size of their project. The user has a deadline to get the project finished by, so they set time goals to complete certain parts by using the program's goal tracking feature. As the user works on their project, they check things off on the goal tracker's checklist to see their progress in relation to how much time is left.
    </p>
	
	<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
    <p>
        A small group of users utilize the local networking capabilities of this program to organize their project. The users connect their computers to a local area network, and the user who decides to host the group creates one on their program. The group members join the host's newly created group and set up their log-ins. The group members periodically have meetings when they brainstorm ideas and add them to the idea list.
    </p>
	
	<h2>Scenario 3</h2>
    <p>
        A large group of users that live in different parts of the world use the program's web host connectivity to organize their project.
